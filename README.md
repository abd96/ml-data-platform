# 🚀 ML-Ready Data Platform Project

## 🎯 Project Goal

Build an **end-to-end data engineering platform** that:
- Ingests or generates simulated interaction data (user-item events)
- Transforms raw data into ML-ready features
- Stores features in a **feature store (Feast)** for training & inference
- Orchestrates workflows with **Airflow**
- Serves features in real-time via **FastAPI**
- Runs fully containerized with **Docker Compose**
- Adds monitoring with **Grafana + Prometheus**

## 🧱 Key Components

| Layer         | Tool/Tech Used                                | Purpose                                              |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Ingestion     | Python scripts (or Kafka later)                | Generate or simulate user-item interaction logs     |
| Storage       | Local filesystem (Parquet), optionally S3      | Store raw and transformed data                      |
| Transformation| Spark (or Pandas), dbt (optional)              | Generate meaningful user/item features              |
| Feature Store | **Feast**                                      | Store & serve features for both training & inference|
| Orchestration | **Airflow**                                    | Schedule feature generation + materialization       |
| Serving       | **FastAPI**                                    | API to return user features to downstream services  |
| Infrastructure| **Docker Compose**                             | Run all services locally in isolated containers     |
| Monitoring    | Redis (for online store), PostgreSQL (Feast DB)| Track freshness, fast lookups, metadata, etc.       |

## 📦 Current Progress

- ✅ Docker Compose setup (Postgres, Redis, Airflow)
- ✅ Local Feast setup and CLI verified
- ✅ Airflow DAG scaffolded
- ✅ Directory structure and starter code generated
- ✅ PostgreSQL and Redis containers running cleanly

---

## 🛠️ Next Steps

1. **Connect Feast repo to Airflow DAG**
   - Define sample features in `feature_defs.py`
   - Materialize features with Airflow task

2. **Generate synthetic data**
   - Simulate interaction logs using Python and Faker
   - Save to `data/raw/interactions.csv`

3. **Write transformation logic**
   - Use Pandas or Spark to extract meaningful features

4. **Serve features via FastAPI**
   - Create `/features/{user_id}` endpoint using Feast's online store

5. **(Optional) Monitoring layer**
   - Add Prometheus + Grafana for job and freshness tracking

## 💡 Final Outcome

You’ll have a complete, production-grade pipeline that demonstrates:
- Data engineering and orchestration
- Feature consistency across training and inference
- Real-time APIs and infrastructure maturity
- Portfolio-ready, highly relevant to ML/Data Engineer roles
